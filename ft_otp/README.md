# Ft_otp

In this project, the aim is to implement a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) system (without using pyotp or any similar library), which will be capable of generating ephemeral passwords from a master key.

### Usage

./ft_otp [-g .hex] [-k ft_otp.key]

- The [-g] option, recieves a file that includes a master key with a 64 hexadecimal characters format, and generates an encrypted ft_otp.key file.
- The [-k] option takes the .key file given as argument, generates the one-time password manually, and prints it, also including the password generated by pyotp library, to check if they are the same.
